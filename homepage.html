                <p>After three months of working together on this project, we, as a team, have experienced a lot of problems and hurdles to solve and overcome. However, we still managed everything well and successfully complete our project together.</p>
                <p>First, at the beginning of this project, our team did not manage time really well, and as a result, we have to spend 100% of our time and effort to complete some of the first stages of the project as soon as possible to make sure that we did not delay the others stages of the project. Secondly, we had not known how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript before when we did this project. Therefore, besides the time we planned to do this project, our team also have to spend more time to learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make sure that we have enough knowledge to build a functional website that meets the qualifications for this assignment. Thirdly, we were not usually asked for advice and just did it by ourselves. Consequently, we as our team always told each other to be more confident and try to get our shell to reach more people and our lecturer to have more advice.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, our teams did not experience any conflicts when we worked together, we always respected other perspective view and analyzed these views carefully before making the decision to choose what was the best for the group to aim for the goal of our project that we have set. Moreover, the team's members were responsible and supportive, they always did the work that they were responsible for and we also told each other to improve our weaknesses to make the project as good as possible. Additionally, if someone on the team had any struggles on the project, we would definitely be willing to help our teams mate as kind of possible as we could, which literally is fairly significant. Moreover, after working on this project, we have a chance to know more about the IT industry. First, we learned that an IT project needs a lot of involvement from different areas and specialties like UI/UX design, Project Manager, Fronted - Designer,  etc. We also learned more about some interesting areas in the industry like machine learning, and AI.</p>
                <p>Non-technical skills, like soft skills, were also important factors that we learned throughout this project. We have known how to plan the process and manage our time to meet the goal that we have set in this assignment. The skill of critical thinking and being creative also had been adapted by us to create the idea for this project.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Team Profile</h2>
            <div class="profile-content">
                <p>For each individual:</p>
                <p>•	Cuong: My ideal job in the future is a Back-End Developer, especially in an AI platform. I was impressed by the applications of AI technology and I want to know how those AI systems work and why they are so intelligent. Recently, Chat GPT was published by OpenAI which helps users solve their problems very effectively with an AI bot. From my perspective, the future of technology is AI and I would love to build an AI system in the future.</p>
                <p>•	Loc: I am passionate about working with Data. I think it would be interesting if I could evaluate a bunch of data and create an efficient strategy for the marketing office. Data analytics would be an ideal job for my future career.</p>
                <p>•	Nguyen: In the future, I really hope to work on an IT project that helps companies to reduce the amount of time of developing and operating a typical IT product. Therefore, I think I going to pursue a career as a DevOps Engineer.</p>
                <p>•	Long: I like to manage or manage something, but it's not business or human resources, it's information. I always want to support, provide information or run an individual or an organization. Or better yet, help my own career path in the future. So I think it will be right for me to choose to study and learn about information management systems (MIS) and become a good engineer in this field.</p>
                <p>Summary:</p>
                <p>•	Similarities: From the above, it can be seen that almost all members of the group have something in common in their vision of their future careers. That is, they all tend to want to work more on the back-end than the front-end. For example, they all talked about wanting to be involved in the development of core operations, evaluating data analytics and strategies, and directly intervening to reduce time for IT products in the process. operations, and manage the amount of information for any business or project, large or small. Moreover, ideally, all members want to bring technology to life or certain fields, as well as want to participate in the development of technology in the near future.</p>
                <p>•	Differences: On the other hand, there are also differences between group members. To talk about the difference it is necessary to go into a little more detail. Those are the specific types of majors in IT, such as Cuong is very interested in AI (Artificial Intelligence), and Loc and Nguyen are interested in data research, strategy, development and operations, and Long wants to manage information for certain business organizations or projects. The arrays above all produce a different amount of work; Knowledge, experience and job pressure are also different.</p>

                    <p>We choose Visual Studio Code (VSC) as our IDE because it has a variety of useful extensions that increase productivity, such as the "live server" extension that makes it easier for users to view websites. We also utilize HTML&CSS to create the prototype. GitHub is the ideal option for us to collaborate as a team since it enables us to code without worrying about a random piece of code breaking the software via the function called "branch". Cuong had already become accustomed to Github, HTML& CSS, due to his work using these applications to create the Flappy Bird game with his team. Loc had already built a website while taking the front-end course "F8" so he was familiar with HTML and CSS on a fundamental level.</p>

Regarding the Back-end, this will be the testing and testing stage of the internal scope, because the whole team will focus on handling errors in the code process, handling conflicts in the process of using back and forth between them. programming tools and programming languages. This inspection process will be carried out continuously from the moment our team starts creating the product until the finished product. We also will not stop this inspection during operation and put it into use later even though the number of problems to be handled will be less in the future.</div>

This initial look is of course part of our personal ideas and design style, so improvements will be made as soon as we do some surveys of about 100 testers including our family, teachers, friends and a few professional testers that we know and asked them to fill out a survey asking about the interface, efficiency, security and convenience of the application.</p></div>

                        <p>We aim to build a website that will assist people in finding beautiful games depending on their personality, daily routine, and interests. Users will be asked many questions to determine their personality type, and our Artificial Intelligence (AI) system will propose games for everyone. This website will have a welcoming homepage, detailed game descriptions, service instructions, and contact information for our staff.</p>
                        <p> We can just design and produce the homepage and a few features for this website right now due to our limited relevant skills, but we feel that once done, it will be a very productive tool for everyone. This website is extremely beneficial because it saves users time when searching for a game, establishes a perfect connection between game developers and players, provides useful recommendations about how much time our users should spend playing those games, and reduces negative and harmful information by selecting games collectively.</p>

                    <p>Our team picked this issue since we saw that people's desire for amusement is growing by the day. Most of us have spent hours looking for a game that matches our interests and the amount of time we have to spend playing games, but we still cannot find the game we desire. Our team members are also game consumers, and we understand how difficult it is to discover acceptable games, therefore we want to establish a website that will assist the community in selecting the game that will satisfy them. Another reason is that most of us are planning to learn web programming the coming semester, so creating a professional website for this project is a great opportunity for us to practice and develop our skills before learning that course.</p>

                    <p class="first">There are numerous of websites that help users to find games but there were only a few websites that recommended users with games which is suitable for their enthusiasm and daily routine, but none of which were applying AI technology. I had spent hours on researching game webistes and I divided those into 3 main types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game review and news website: These websites provide game reviews, previews, and news. They frequently have a huge editorial staff that plays and writes about a diverse range of games. IGN, GameSpot, and Polygon are a few examples.</li>
                        <li>Game distribution platforms: Users may buy and download games from these websites. They may also include elements like forums, social networking, and achievements. Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store are a few examples.</li>
                        <li>Game discovery platforms: These websites assist consumers in discovering new games that match their hobbies or tastes. They may propose games based on a user's play history or ratings, or they may allow users to explore games by genre, topic, or other criteria. itch.io and Humble Bundle are two examples.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="second">Our team had dicuss and together decided to choose which features of those websites are necessary for our website. We tried to apply some similar functions such as game recommendations, page to select types of game, forums,… However, the most special and unique feature that is only in our website is game recommendations by AI technology, which help users exploring the suitable games for them more flexibly and accurately.</p>
